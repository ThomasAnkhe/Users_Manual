# PEPI Manual — Phase Contrast Imaging with Geant4:

This repository provides documentation and resources to facilitate the use of **Geant4** in the context of the **PEPI** (Photon-counting Edge-illumination Phase-contrast Imaging) project implementation. It is mainly intended for users and researchers working with **edge-illumination X-ray phase-contrast imaging (EI-XPCI)**, but any other modality of phase contrast can be achieved in this general code.

## 📖 About:

Inside this repository, you will find a comprehensive **User’s Manual**, designed to help understand the theoretical background and practical implementation of the EI technique in PEPI.

The manual was initially written by **David López** and **Isabela Ávila** (2024), and later expanded and revised by **Thomas Andrade** and **Juan José Guzmán** (2025) with new information focused in the Edge-Illumination by a single mask method.

All content is freely available and may be updated as new information or improved implementations become available.
