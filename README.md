# User's Manual ‚Äî Phase Contrast Imaging with Geant4:

This repository provides documentation and resources to facilitate the use of **Geant4** in the context of the **PEPI** (Photon-counting Edge-illumination Phase-contrast Imaging) project implementation. It is mainly intended for users and researchers working with **edge-illumination X-ray phase-contrast imaging (EI-XPCI)**, but any other modality of phase contrast can be achieved in this general code.

## üìñ About:

Inside this repository, you will find a comprehensive **User‚Äôs Manual**, designed to help understand the theoretical background and practical implementation of the EI technique in PEPI.

The manual was initially written by **David L√≥pez** and **Isabela √Åvila** (2024), and later expanded and revised by **Thomas Andrade** and **Juan Jos√© Guzm√°n** (2025) with new information focused in the Edge-Illumination by a single mask method.

All content is freely available and may be updated as new information or improved implementations become available.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use:

**1.** Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThomasAnkhe/Users_Manual.git
   ```
**2.** Read the Users_Manual.pdf available and try to follow the explanations using either the Phantom or the Tube source.

## üöß Work in Progress

We plan to include a section where users can learn how to implement **multithreading** in their simulations, aiming to reduce the computational load of individual runs and improve performance.

Additionally, future updates of the manual and source code will consider the integration of more robust and accurate **phase retrieval algorithms**, to enhance the quality of the reconstructed images.

We are also exploring the development of a **graphical user interface (GUI)** that will allow users to analyze results without directly interacting with the Jupyter Notebook (for no precise reason at all honestly).
